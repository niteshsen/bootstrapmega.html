            <h1>Food in Ireland</h1>
             <p>These are some of my favourite Irish foods!</p>
             <h2>Traditional Irish Breakfast</h2>
             <p>A "Full Irish" breakfast consists of sausages, rashers(bacon), eggs, black pudding, white pudding  and toast.</p>
             <p>often there will be a grilled tomato as well as mushrooms, and baked beans.</p>
             <p>And of course,no breakfast is complete without a lovely pot of tea!</p>
             <h2>Bangers and Mash </h2>
             <p>This classic of suasages, mashed potato and gravy is not unique to Ireland, but what makes it special is the Irish
                                          sausages. Most countries have their own way of making sausages, and they are one thing I miss from home if i'm away travelling!</p>
                                          <h2>Bacon and Cabbage</h2>
                                          <p>I could't possibly make a list of Irish food without including this very traditional dish!</p>

                                          <p>It might not sound very interesting, but this hearty meal of boiled ham, potatoes and green cabbage is tasty and filling. I love to smother the potatoes in butter, and I also little mustered with bacon.</p>

                                          <p> My mum always made it extra special by cooking the cabbage in the water that the ham was boiled in .</p>

                                          <p> IF there are any leftovers you can another one of  my favourite: <strong>fried cabbage</strong>!</p>
